# Jay's blogs

This is a repo containing all of the blogs I posted on my website, you can view them on my website by going to [jellyware( )](https://jellyware.co.uk/).

Each individual blog post has the following structure:

```bash
|-- blog_post
|   |-- Images_dir
|   |-- index.md
```

where `index.md` contains the actual text for the blog.
